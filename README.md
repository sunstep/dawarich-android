## Motivation
More than one year ago, I came across the FOSS project called Dawarich. Dawarich was and still is a project that I was looking for around the time. I was already self hosting my stuff, but I wasn't self hosting anything as alternative to Google Maps Timeline.
When I got everything working, I immediately saw the potential of Dawarich, but I also immediately noticed that it's not really useful without its own mobile client. Dawarich used to rely on generic GPS trackers, but those aren't good enough for Dawarich because they don't align with Dawarich's feature set.
My goal with this app is to provide you Dawarich right into your mobile without the need for a web browser. This is an unofficial client, so it's not officially associated with the creator of Dawarich. One advantage of that is that this mobile client is a community approach. So choices here are community made. 

I never expected to get this far in the development of the app, but now that I am, I got no other choice but to share it with you. For a really long time, I kept this app to myself, fully privately, because I was very slow in developing this app. I go to college 5 days per week, and next to that I work 20 hours per week.
I am just a student, so as you can imagine there is not much time to work on this project and even when I do work on it, I am not the most experienced person. This is my first time I am ever releasing a project into the public, it took a lot of courage to do this, so I really hope you appreciate this project :)

Please feel free to follow me on GitHub and star this project, so I can make my mom proud :)

# Issues, feature requests or inquiries
If you would like to create a bug report or report issues with the app, you can create an issue in the issues page of this repository. I currently do not follow a template, so you can write it however you like, but I can tell you upfront that it will speed up the process if you are as descriptive as possible, and tell me as much as you can, for example steps to reproduce.

If you have ideas in mind for this app, you can also submit it at the issues page of this repository, if you suggest something, be as descriptive as possible, so it is clear for me what you are asking for exactly. Please note that I already have a lot of plans in mind, and I am aware that there is a lot that needs to be implemented to align this app with Dawarich's feature set, but there is only so much I can implement in so little time.
If you have inquiries you can also submit an issue or you can simply chat with me in the official Dawarich Discord server, in the community-solutions channel. That is most likely the quickest way to get your answer. My Discord username is 'thesunstep'.
